  description: 'Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created

    request, there''s a briefdelay while Amazon Route 53 creates the resource record
    sets that are specified in the traffic policydefinition. For more information,
    see the State response element.Send a GET request to the /Amazon Route 53 APIversion/trafficpolicyinstance
    resource and include the ID of the hostedzone.Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum
    of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of trafficpolicy instances, you
    can use the MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of upto 100.The response
    includes four values that help you navigate from one group ofMaxItems traffic
    policy instances to the next:             IsTruncated               If the value
    of IsTruncated in the response is true, there aremore traffic policy instances
    associated with the current AWS account.If IsTruncated is false, this response
    includes the lasttraffic policy instance that is associated with the current account.             MaxItems           The

    more traffic policy instances, make another call toListTrafficPolicyInstancesByHostedZone,

        53 performs the following operations:Amazon Route 53 creates a new group of
        resource record sets based on the specified trafficpolicy. This is true regardless
        of how substantial the differences are between theexisting resource record
        sets and the new resource record sets. When all of the new resource record
        sets have been created, Amazon Route 53 starts to respondto DNS queries for
        the root resource record set name (such as example.com) by using thenew resource
        record sets.Amazon Route 53 deletes the old group of resource record sets
