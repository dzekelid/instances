  title: Google Compute Engine API Schedule Recreate of Instance
  description: Schedules a group action to recreate the specified instances in the
    managed instance group. The instances are deleted and recreated using the current
    instance template for the managed instance group. This operation is marked as
    DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been recreated.
    You must separately verify the status of the recreating action with the listmanagedinstances
    method.
