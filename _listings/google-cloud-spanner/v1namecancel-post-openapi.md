  title: Google Cloud Spanner API Cancel Instance
  description: |-
    Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The server
    makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
    guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
    `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use
    Operations.GetOperation or
    other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the
    operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,
    the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with
    an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,
    corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

      summary: Update Instance
      description: |-
        Updates an instance, and begins allocating or releasing resources
        as requested. The returned long-running
        operation can be used to track the
        progress of updating the instance. If the named instance does not
        exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`.

        Immediately upon completion of this request:

          * For resource types for which a decrease in the instance's allocation
            has been requested, billing is based on the newly-requested level.

        Until completion of the returned operation:

          * Cancelling the operation sets its metadata's
            cancel_time, and begins
            restoring resources to their pre-request values. The operation
            is guaranteed to succeed at undoing all resource changes,
            after which point it terminates with a `CANCELLED` status.
          * All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected.
          * Reading the instance via the API continues to give the pre-request
            resource levels.

        Upon completion of the returned operation:

          * Billing begins for all successfully-allocated resources (some types
            may have lower than the requested levels).
          * All newly-reserved resources are available for serving the instance's
            tables.
          * The instance's new resource levels are readable via the API.

        The returned long-running operation will
        have a name of the format `<instance_name>/operations/<operation_id>` and
        can be used to track the instance modification.  The
        metadata field type is
        UpdateInstanceMetadata.
        The response field type is
        Instance, if successful.

        Authorization requires `spanner.instances.update` permission on
        resource name.

      summary: Create instance
      description: |-
        Creates an instance and begins preparing it to begin serving. The
        returned long-running operation
        can be used to track the progress of preparing the new
        instance. The instance name is assigned by the caller. If the
        named instance already exists, `CreateInstance` returns
        `ALREADY_EXISTS`.

        Immediately upon completion of this request:

          * The instance is readable via the API, with all requested attributes
            but no allocated resources. Its state is `CREATING`.

        Until completion of the returned operation:

          * Cancelling the operation renders the instance immediately unreadable
            via the API.
          * The instance can be deleted.
          * All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected.

        Upon completion of the returned operation:

          * Billing for all successfully-allocated resources begins (some types
            may have lower than the requested levels).
          * Databases can be created in the instance.
          * The instance's allocated resource levels are readable via the API.
          * The instance's state becomes `READY`.

        The returned long-running operation will
        have a name of the format `<instance_name>/operations/<operation_id>` and
        can be used to track creation of the instance.  The
        metadata field type is
        CreateInstanceMetadata.
        The response field type is
        Instance, if successful.
